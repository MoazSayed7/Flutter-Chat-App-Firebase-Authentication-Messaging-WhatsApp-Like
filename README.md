## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Flutter-Chat-App-Firebase-Authentication-Messaging-WhatsApp-Like
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```
4. Configure Firebase:
   - Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Enable the required Firebase services for your app, including Firestore, Authentication, and Cloud Messaging.

5. Set up Firebase for your project by following the [Using Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup).

6. ### Customized `chat_bubbles` Package

I have made custom modifications to the `chat_bubbles` package to enhance the text alignment feature. Specifically, I have added the ability to dynamically set the text alignment within the chat bubbles.

1. Added a new parameter to the `BubbleSpecialThree` class:

   ```dart
   final TextAlign textAlign;
   ```

2. Initialized the `textAlign` parameter in the constructor:

   ```dart
   this.textAlign = TextAlign.left;
   ```

3. Applied the dynamic text alignment in the widget tree in line 97 (line 97 before making the above edits) :

   ```dart
   textAlign: textAlign
   ```

 #### Implementation Details

The changes are made in the `bubble_special_three.dart` file located in the following path:

```
%LocalAppData%\Pub\Cache\hosted\pub.dev\chat_bubbles-1.5.0\lib\bubbles\bubble_special_three.dart
```

Users can find the modified file in this location and review the changes made for better understanding.

7. Run the app:

```bash
flutter run
